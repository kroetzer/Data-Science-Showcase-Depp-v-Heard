# Data-Science-Showcase-Depp-v-Heard
## Multi-Method Data Science showcase (SICSS 2022 project) 


This is our SICSS (Summer Institute in Computational Social Science) 2022 Aachen-Graz project. In 4.5 days, we investigated the debate regarding the Depp v Heard case on Twitter. 

This project serves as a showcase for data-driven approaches that tackle (research) questions by employing and integrating multiple methods of data analysis: from in-depth 'small scale' qualitative analysis to 'big scale' sentiment, polarisation, and network analysis of Twitter data.  

We are happy to share our [presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ay6oJa5-CmtNZbGCbK5ZqrW0xJLcWIGr/view?usp=sharing), in which we are reporting on general approach and design, research questions and hypotheses, data selection criteria, data collection, data analysis, and results, as well as our code (jupyter notebooks). Please note that we must not share the original tweets we used for our analysis. We do share the selection criteria we used, i.e. the query we used for the Twitter API.
